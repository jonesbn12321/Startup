Put your memory to the test and see what monsters you can match!

> [!NOTE]
> This is a template for your startup application. You must modify this `README.md` file for each phase of your development. You only need to fill in the section for each deliverable when that deliverable is submitted in Canvas. Without completing the section for a deliverable, the TA will not know what to look for when grading your submission. Feel free to add additional information to each deliverable description, but make sure you at least have the list of rubric items and a description of what you did for each item.

### Key features

- Secure login
- Ability to choose an opponent
- Fun, interactive memory game
- Ability to play against an opponent in real time
- Record from each game played displayed

### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - This will be the basic structure of the website. There will be 4 HTML pages. One for login, one for opponent selection, one for the game, and one for viewing the records.
- **CSS** - This will be used to make the website nice and pretty. There will be nice colors, spacing, formatting, and ensuring that it looks good on multiple screen sizes. 
- **React** - This is how I will make the game interactive, enabling users to flip cards. It will also keep track of the scores. 
- **Service** - This is how the website will save the game results and send information between the players. 
- **DB/Login** - This will store the user accounts and information such as scores. When users login, their scores will be saved so that they can view them later.
- **WebSocket** - Enable 2 browsers to talk to each other through the server, this will enable two people to play together at the same time.
