### Key features

- Secure login
- Ability to choose an opponent
- Fun, interactive memory game
- Ability to play against an opponent in real time
- Record from each game played displayed

### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - This will be the basic structure of the website. There will be 4 HTML pages. One for login, one for opponent selection, one for the game, and one for viewing the records.
- **CSS** - This will be used to make the website nice and pretty. There will be nice colors, spacing, formatting, and ensuring that it looks good on multiple screen sizes. 
- **React** - This is how I will make the game interactive, enabling users to flip cards. It will also keep track of the scores. 
- **Service** - This is how the website will save the game results and send information between the players. 
- **DB/Login** - This will store the user accounts and information such as scores. When users login, their scores will be saved so that they can view them later.
- **WebSocket** - Enable 2 browsers to talk to each other through the server, this will enable two people to play together at the same time.
